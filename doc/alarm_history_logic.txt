### Store alarms info to the database

- When we receive the data from the device, first get tag info to determine if it is the alarm.
- If so, get last value of that alarm from the "alarm_status" table.
- Compare that last value with streaming value.
- If there is no last value in the table, only save streaming value if it is true as alarm activated time.
- If last value is false and streaming value is true, save streaming value into the "alarm_status" table as alarm activated time.
- If last value is true and streaming value is false, save streaming value into the "alarm_status" table as alarm resolved time.


### Display alarms

- Get last value of the machine's alarms and display it in the alarms list if it is activated.
- Get the list of alarm history from the "alarm_status" table and display it in the alarm history list.
